## Catminator
This is a take home project for the client Albertson.<br />

## Instruction
Core functionality:<br />
• User opens the app and is presented with a random image of a cat along with a random cat fact.
• Each subsequent tap on the screen will generate a new random image and new cat fact 

Key Requirement:
• Project is written in Swift<br />
• Use VIPER or MVVM architecture<br />
• Unit tests<br />
• Third party frameworks are permitted for any basic feature of the app.<br /> 

## Acceptance Criteria
• App should compile and run successfully with minimal or no warnings <br /> 
• User is presented with random cat facts and pics as well as correct interactions- APIs are called every time user taps screen<br />
• No crashing or other errors<br />
• Proper separation of responsibilities per MVVM or VIPER architecture<br />
